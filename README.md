# Tower-of-Hanoi-Game
A program based on the vietnamese game "The tower of Hanoi"

In the tower of Hanoi, the goal is to move all disks in a particular rod to the target rod and have it look exactly the same as when you started. The big rods are to be at the bottom with the smallest at the top. A big rod must be below a smaller one, it cannot be above a rod smaller than it. Moving these rods as efficiently as possible - and with minimal wasted steps can be used to assess someone's cognitive ability. 

To play the game, download the code into your IDE and install Pygame (It is likely your IDE will probably indicate the need to install this package when you try to run the code). 

Have fun!
